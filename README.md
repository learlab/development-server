# Learlab Development Server!

In this repository, you will find configuration files for our lab server. These files describe how the server is configured for JupyterHub.

We use JupyterHub to orchestrate containerized development environments. This allows us to collaborate on projects and share computational resources across the lab. Containerization provides security and isolation between development environments. The containers are also configured to encourage best practices in scientific computing. Essential tools like version control come pre-installed, thanks to our [custom Docker images](https://github.com/learlab/jupyter-development-dockers). We prepared [wiki](https://github.com/learlab/development-server/wiki) to help lab members make the most of these tools.

The [wiki](https://github.com/learlab/development-server/wiki) has useful information for users and system deployment documentation for maintainers.
